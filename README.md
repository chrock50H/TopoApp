### Only a Front-End, the idea is

for TopoRemedialAction / Gridstatealteration:

- Generate Testdata for CGMES (NetworkCodeProfiles)
- Backoffice Calculations, preparing topo RA
- Data Exchange Crossborder through randomized (hashed) DifferenceModels (RemedialActionSchedule)
- it should be able load all kinds of timeseries / schedules an generate Delta Timeseries for CSA-DAtA-Exchange.-
   
Backoffice Implementation in python, some other options might follow. Shoud be locally deployable in different environments.
